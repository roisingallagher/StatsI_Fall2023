# Calculate sample mean
sample_mean <- mean(IQ_scores) # calculating the average IQ

# Calculate sample standard deviation
sample_std <- sd(IQ_scores) # calculating the standard deviation of IQ

# Sample size
n <- length(IQ_scores) # number of the students in the dataset

# Confidence level (90%)
confidence_level <- 0.90 

# Calculate the critical t-value
critical_t <- 1.71 # we can find this critical t-value from a t-table by knowing the degrees of freedom and the confidence interval
# found at https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/students-t-table/

# Calculate the margin of error
margin_of_error <- critical_t * (sample_std / sqrt(n)) # calculating the error margin 

# Calculate the confidence interval
lower_bound <- sample_mean - margin_of_error
upper_bound <- sample_mean + margin_of_error
